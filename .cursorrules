# Yoav Fun Packages - Cursor Rules

## Project Structure
This is a monorepo containing multiple fun web applications and packages.

## Package Management
- **Use yarn workspaces** for all package management operations
- **Never use npm directly** - always use yarn workspace commands
- To run dev server: `yarn workspace [package-name] dev`
- To install dependencies: `yarn workspace [package-name] add [dependency]`
- To build: `yarn workspace [package-name] build`

## Current Packages
- `matan-trainings`: Progressive Web App for workout tracking with Hebrew UI

## Development Commands
- Start matan-trainings dev server: `yarn workspace matan-trainings dev`
- Build matan-trainings: `yarn workspace matan-trainings build`
- Install root dependencies: `yarn install`

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER use `git push`** - only commit changes with `git commit`
- The user will handle all pushing to remote repositories
- Always use `git add` and `git commit` for saving changes
- Never run `git push` under any circumstances

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices
- Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use modern CSS features and flexbox/grid layouts
